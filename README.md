# QEMU virtual device playground

**Chicken or Egg? Development or Exploit..?**

## Description

Here are some example of QEMU virtual PCI devices.

## Contents

Refer to [device dir](./device/README.md).

## Start testing

```start.sh
cd $HOME && wget https://download.qemu.org/qemu-6.1.0.tar.xz
tar xvf qemu-6.1.0.tar.xz
git clone https://github.com/smallkirby/qemu-vdevice-testing.git
cd ./qemu-vdevice-testing

# Edit build-tree here #

./deploy.sh
```

To build your virtual device, you have to make it be included in build-tree. QEMU uses kconfig build system, but (I think) there is no GUI setting. So just apply below patch.

```patch-build.sh
### Add this in `/hw/misc/Kconfig
config SKB_SIMPLEST
    bool
    default y
    depends on PCI && MSI_NONBROKEN

### Add this in `/hw/misc/meason.build`
softmmu_ss.add(when: 'CONFIG_SKB_SIMPLEST', if_true: files('skb-simplest.c'))

### Add this in `/targets/x86_64-softmmu-config-devices.mak`
CONFIG_SKB_SIMPLEST=y
```

## Check if your device is really installed

```test.sh
# QEMU recognizes your device.
$ $QEMUBIN -device help | grep skb
name "skb-simplest", bus PCI, desc "Sample Port I/O PCI device for skb."

# the PCI device is recognized by kernel (in guest shell).
# `skb-simplest` has 00FF, 1234:1337 as Class, VendorID:DeviceID
# `VendorID` is 0x1234 (`PCI_VENDOR_ID_QEMU`). `DeviceID` is leet.
/ # lspci | grep 1337
00:04.0 Class 00ff: 1234:1337
```

## Env

Tested only on Linux(Ubuntu 20.04), QEMU v6.1.0, Linux v5.10.25(as Guest).
